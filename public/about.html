<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Gavin Cross. I am taking every step possible to achieve my dream of becoming a computer engineer and then hopefully
get a job (or start a company) in the aerospace field. Currently, I am pursuing my AS in Computer Science from my local
community college that is partnered with 4-year universities across the state of Virginia. I have also already spoken to an advisor
about the potential steps needed to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working on a 60+ hour Udemy Web Development course that covers React, Javascript, CS, C++, and more. From this course,
  I will gain the knowledge, skills, and be able to build a portfolio to land an entry-level web development job.

<p>In my personal life, I am the dad of 3 beautiful dogs and 1 adorable cat. I have a Jack Russell/Blue Heeler mix named Jesse(F) 
  who has turned 4 this past July. She is an absolute angel and my best friend until the end. She is a resuce from the fine state of
  Alabama. I found her on Craigslist listed for free and thought it was a scam at first. The lady sent a few pictures but only of 
  black and white ones. When I got there, I was led out back and then Jesse (brown, white, black) came running around the corner.
  The other puppy was taking a leak on the sidewalk nervous as could be but Jesse ran and jumped up on me. She has never done this
  to another human being to this day. She absolutely hates people. We've always lived in a complex of some sort so there have always 
  been people and other dogs but she seriously does not like them getting near her or us. 
  Then, came Pipperson. Little Pippy or Pip
  is an adorable Mountain Feist (rare treeing breed in most parts). She has very floppy ears that look like a WW2 or WW1 leather pilot
  helmet. She gets the zoombies and is food feisty (not aggressive). We paid a rehoming fee for her but she was also technically a resuce.
  She was being kept outside at this crazy animal farm in PA. There were tons of them. Like all kinds of animals and types of dogs kept
  outside mid winter on mud and dirt in these giant fence cages. She was the runt and we believe she was surviving off of poop. She used
  to drink pee too or try to while Jesse went but we broke that habbit. The poop is in the works still.
    Then came Lord Vader. We thought he was entirely black. Turned out, 
  he is brindle. Just black and graay and barely any white hairs but they are there. Last but not least, came Jax. He is a Jack Russell
  pure bred. We went to just play with puppies one day at our local puppy store and my girlfriend came over to me and said, "The two
  Jack Russells have been here longer than anyone else. 85 days they've been in those little boxes". They were the oldest ones there. It
  was just Jax and his sister. Both were adorable but Jax was staring at me and jumping up and down trying to get to me as I played (or
  attempted to play) with this little fuzzy thing. I made eye contact with him and he stopped jumping, let out a little whine and wagged his
  nub like a mad man. I told my girlfriend that I wanted him. We have him. He was expensive and our only 'non-official resuce' but it didn't 
  appear that  many people going in and out of there were interested in real dogs. They wanted show dogs and lap dogs.
    Besides my animals, I enjoy reading philosphy, sci-fi, and business books. I also enjoy gaming on Xbox and PC. I enjoy FPS and 3rd person
  RPG games along the themes of military (any point in history), space, or medieval fantasy.</p>
