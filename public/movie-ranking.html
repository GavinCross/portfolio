<h1>My Top 3 Film Picks of History</h1>
<hr />

    <h2>Avatar</h2>
    <p>The FX in this film are beyond stunning for being made in 2009. The graphics still surpass many filmns and TV shows produced
        in 2023. It just so happens to be my grandpas favorite movie as well which shocked me! He stated it was his favorite because
        he found it beautiful to watch and I can't say I disagree. It is so much more than beautiful to look at though. It is 
        beautiful down to the soul and root meaning of life. It makes you want to go hug a jellyfish tree, that's for sure.

    <h2>Avatar: The Way of Water</h2>
    <p>Did I mention I enjoy James Cameron films? I mean, c'mon... the man is an absolute legend. Not only does he make visually
        beautiful movies but he also gets his inspiration through completing science. I've not heard of another director being as 
        dedicated to creating a universe like Mr. Cameron. I'm sure the rest of the Avatar movies that are coming out in the coming
        years may make it to my website as well.

    <h2>Freddy vs Jason</h2>
    <p>This one was a summer classic for my older brother and I growing up. I mean, countless times over one summer I can vividly
        remember watching this movie almost every other day it felt like. We used to fight each other afterwards. My brother would be
        Jason Vorhees due to his body build, which left me to be the wimpy Freddy who gets to use speed to their advantage. If you 
        have not seen Freddy vs Jason, it's a must watch. Now, don't go grabbing blankets and your boyfriend thinking you're going to
        jump out of your seats like its 'The Conjuring' (or kick your mom in the side). This flick will get you excited for Halloween.
